I'm pretty stoked to start blogging and teaching computer science. As a late-comer to the field, I know how to bridge the gap between those who understand and those who don't.

I also know how much breadth and repetition it takes to really have these concepts sink it. It doesn't feel good enough to know the minimum you need to build something. You only know you're using the right tools the right way when you have a firm grasp of the tools you aren't using. For example, if you study html, css, javascript and php, in cycles, every time you get back around to php, you'll be primed for understanding php at some deeper level because you understand how the parts it interacts with work at a deeper level.

What I hope to accomplish here is to make computer science concepts more digestible and palatable--to fill in the gaps that most tutorials leave or expect you to already know. I will include lists of prerequisites and suggest options to learn things I may be glazing over.

So let's begin with basic programming concepts.
